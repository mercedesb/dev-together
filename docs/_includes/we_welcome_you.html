        There is no gatekeeping in our community. If you have written code, you are a developer â€” no matter
        what language, how many
        lines, or for how long.
      </p>
      <p>
        Whether you prefer Windows or Mac, front-end or back-end, tabs or spaces, you are a real developer and
        we want you to join us. Regardless of your background, we offer technical mentorship to help support you in your
        development
        career.
