      <p class="Subtitle">We want to create an inclusive, experiential learning space for developers of all backgrounds and experience levels to grow.</p>
      <p>By supporting people from diverse backgrounds, we can improve representation in the tech industry and ensure that the people building software are representative of the people who use it.</p>
      <p>We believe in in-person events that provide a personalized learning experience and move beyond syntax and the shiny new tech.</p>
