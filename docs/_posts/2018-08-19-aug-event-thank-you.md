Our third event took place this past week at Sittercity. It's always so great to see so many new faces and to connect with our friends who join us again. Weâ€™ve received several notes from Mentees saying how much they enjoyed the event and that they are looking forward to future events. It always blows me away to watch the conversations and enthusiasm at our events; we have such an amazing group every time.

Sittercity was a wonderful host with a great space. We're always grateful to our sponsors for their generosity and for keeping their doors open late for us.
