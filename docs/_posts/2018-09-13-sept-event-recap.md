This month’s event happened this past Tuesday at RedShelf. It was a beautiful day and they opened their rooftop to us for some ah-mazing sunset, cityscape pairing. You really can’t beat that kind of atmosphere.

The event opened with RedShelf’s CTO Scott Kelly providing some background info about our hosts and what they build. RedShelf was founded with a lofty objective: to improve education through product innovation. They build products to make textbooks affordable and accessible and recently surpassed 1.5 million students using their products. We can definitely get behind a company who’s mission aligns so closely with ours and is looking to improve education for all students.

We had so many interesting projects this month. We saw some portfolio websites, a transit issue reporting app, a roman numeral converter and a cool little browser based synth. There were also great conversations about interviewing and some upcoming interviews our members have as well as some talk about imposter syndrome. The feedback we receive from Mentees is overwhelmingly positive and almost always includes a comment about how much they learn from our Mentors about both code and professional skills.

One of our Mentors reached out after the event with a great piece of feedback that really highlights how we all benefit from mentorship whether we are providing it or receiving it.

>Thanks again for organizing the meetup.  It helps me re-think my position and moving from "doing" to trying to develop “doers.” … It's been a bunch of people that have taught me that people aren't scalable, teams are.  I'm at that point where meetings are starting to dominate my schedule which is a sign I'm doing this incorrectly, so this meetup is additional practice in how I need to change my career.  It's better than altruism: it's mutually beneficial.

Our next event is Tuesday October 9 at UCX (233 S. Wacker Dr. Ste 9425). We’re mixing it up a bit and we’re going to do a series of 5-10 minute lightning talks with a theme of "Dev practices: what I wish I was taught.” We hope to see you there!
