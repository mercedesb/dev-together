We are so excited for next week's lightning talk event with the theme of "Dev practices: what I wish I was taught."
We've finalized the schedule!

We'll start the evening with our generous sponsor UCX saying a few words.

## 6:10
Andy Lester ([@petdance](https://twitter.com/petdance)) will kick things off with a talk about "What I wish
students were being taught these days." A quick run-down of skills that grads seem to be missing when they start in the
real world of programming professionally.

## 6:20 
Aji Slater ([@DoodlingDev](https://twitter.com/DoodlingDev)) will talk to us about "Commit Message to the
Rescue." Commit messages are an opportunity to leave context for code changes, and can be a lifesaver for other
developers on your projects. Get a few tips for writing good messages, and a few tricks.

## 6:30
Mina Slater ([@Minar528](https://twitter.com/Minar528)) will tell us why "Error Messages Are Your Friends." An
error message can be super scary: they always take up a ton of space with the stack trace; they're a lot of times red
and angry. But you'll see that they provide a powerful tool for guiding dev.

## 6:40 
Thomas Wilburn will be covering "Accessibility testing in the palm of your hand." I had always put off
accessibility testing, given how hard it seemed to get started. But these days, everyone has a screen reader that's
easy enough to learn, we can do it in 5-10 minutes.

## 6:50
Eleni Chappen ([@echappen](https://twitter.com/echappen)) is going to tell us "What I wish I learned about
React/NPM package management" which will be a great primer for this popular domain but also for learning Javascript in
general.

## 7:00
Jeremy Hanna is going to give us "Deploying software 101." We spend a lot of time discussing good software design
, but how is the code we work on updated on the servers our users hit? A quick break down of different deployment
strategies that companies use.

## 7:10
Doug Bell ([@preaction](https://twitter.com/preaction)) will tell us his thoughts on "The Features of Good
Documentation." He'll explain what good documentation looks like, the benefits it provides, and some tips on writing
good documentation.

## 7:20
Mat Biscan will wrap up our night with "Vim: Never Use a Mouse Again." Why he loves it and the possibilities it
provides, including the fact that you never have to touch your mouse -- which makes it highly efficient as daily text
editor.
