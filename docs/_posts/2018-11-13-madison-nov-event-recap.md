Our Madison chapter had their first ever event this past Tuesday at Bendyworks. The capitol looked awesome at night, and Bendyworks' office space was beautiful with its leather couches, wooden floors, and mini-kitchen.

We can't thank Bendyworks enough for providing us the space we needed for our first event. Bendyworks makes web and mobile apps. If you have an app idea and want it built, check them out! They are also hiring. See [their careers page](https://bendyworks.com/careers) for more details!

We started our event by going over the driver/navigator pairing pattern we use at our Code Review & Pairing events -- the mentee as the driver and the mentor as the navigator. More info about how that works [here]({{ '/blog/pairing-driver-navigator' | prepend: site.baseurl }}). Mentors and mentees then got together and got busy pairing!

At the end of the event, everybody gave an enthusiastic "thumbs up" when asked how the event experience was. ðŸ˜„

Our next event is on Tuesday, December 11 for another Code Review and Pairing session. [Hardin Design and Development](http://www.hardindd.com/) will be hosting us at 150 E Gilman St, Ste B-2200 here in Madison and will be providing food. We hope you can join us there!
