Thank you to everyone who came out for our May Code Review & Pairing event. It's always fun to see you all and learn together. ðŸ¤—

We want to give a huge thank you to [Cameo](https://www.cameo.com/) who hosted our Chicago chapterâ€™s May Code Review & Pairing event. Cameo is a startup that lets customers buy personalized messages from celebrities to share with friends for special occasions. They've been expanding a lot recently and their space is huge. There are picnic tables, couches, and conference rooms with murals. It's always nice to have a space where our pairs can spread out and get comfortable.

Every month that we come together, we get to see a lot of really awesome projects and this month was no different. We saw a pet sitting project that facilitated a really incredible discussion about database architecture and a deep dive into relational databases and how they work. Another Mentee brought a music composition app that leverages Chrome's Web MIDI API (so awesome to be able to plug in a little portable keyboard and have the browser know what's being played!). The pair spent the event troubleshooting some client/server communication issues, and it was a great reminder that it doesn't matter how long you've been coding, small bugs often take the most time to debug.

We had a pair that worked through project goals and converted a vanilla Javascript app to React using Create React App. And we had another group that had a conversation about accessibility and who both connected through another wonderful Chicago Meetup, [Chicago Digital Accessibility and Inclusive Design](https://www.meetup.com/a11ychi/). You should check it out! It is really mindblowing how much our pairs can accomplish in a focused 90-minute pairing session.

As always, we want to thank our Mentors for their time and commitment to our community. We appreciate you!

Next month will be our 1-year anniversary celebration and we're currently ironing out the final details. We'll be sharing those shortly. Can you believe it's been a year!?
