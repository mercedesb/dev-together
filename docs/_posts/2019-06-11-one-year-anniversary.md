What started as a little "what if..." has quickly grown to a community of hundreds of passionate people learning together and supporting each other.

In just one short year, Dev Together has been able to accomplish incredible things.

We have 2 chapters, one in Chicago and one in Madison. We’ve held over 19 events and counting.

In our Chicago chapter alone, we’ve had 218 different, unique attendees at our events. And for our flagship Code Review & Pairing events, we’ve code reviewed and pair programmed on 74 distinct projects, had 42 different mentors volunteer their time, and had 66 mentees get personal support on their code.

To see more of what we’ve been able to accomplish, check out [the project we unit tested and deployed at our 1-year anniversary celebration](http://thankyou.devtogether.co/).

Thank you to everyone who attended our celebration and special thanks to [Alpha Particle](https://alphaparticle.com) and [Tandem](https://madeintandem.com) for hosting and feeding us.
