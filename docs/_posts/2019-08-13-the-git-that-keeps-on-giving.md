Doug Bell led this month's event with an introductory Git workshop. He covered the basics of source control and version control (and explained the terminology). He walked us through Git patches, diffs, and logs. He also explained branching and merging and handling conflicts. 

He even found time to talk backup and recovery strategies. If you bork your local repo, how do you make sure you can get back to where you were? ðŸ˜±

One of the biggest takeaways from Doug's talk is that Git is simple to use, but that doesn't necessarily mean that it's easy. Git is powerful and can be as simple or as complicated as you make it. `git help` is your friend so don't be afraid to use the vanilla commands to start and then learn about the additional flags and options that each command gives you. 

And don't feel as though there is a "right" way or a "wrong" way to do things. There are many strategies to achieve the same goals (as we learned by our discussion on branching strategies) and what matters is what works for you and your team.

All of [Doug's slides can be found here](http://preaction.me/git/) along with some links to helpful Git resources. And if you have questions for Doug, you can find him at almost all of our events (he's such a great mentor!) or on Twitter [@preaction](https://twitter.com/preaction)
