      <p>Our flagship Code Review & Pairing events take advantage of these two development practices for 1:1 learning by
        matching
        up an experienced developer Mentor with a Mentee.</p>
      <p>
        Code reviews and pair programming are common in the workplace but are often overlooked as mentorship opportunities.
        Code reviews offer a unique opportunity to learn from code you wrote while pairing is the
        chance to learn practical development skills such as debugging, refactoring, and architecture.</p>
      
      <h2 class="h3">Mentor roles & responsibilities</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Have a proficient to expert understanding of at least one language/framework</li>
        <li>Complete a code review with feedback prior to the event</li>
        <li>Pair program with Mentee to review and start implementing your suggestions</li>
      </ul>
      <p> As a Mentor, you will get coaching in productive code reviews, giving feedback, and pairing. Being a Mentor is a
        great experience to build empathy and learn how to build better teams.
      </p>
      <h2 class="h3">Mentee roles & responsibilities</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Provide a link to some code for your Mentor to review. There is no minimum requirement! It can be 3 lines of code
          that you're trying to understand or a working app that you want to optimize.</li>
        <li>Provide some information about what you are looking to learn</li>
        <li>Pair program with your Mentor to start implementing some of their suggestions</li>
      </ul>
      <p>As a Mentee, you will get to practice Git flows, receiving code review feedback, and pair programming. All of these
        are skills to put on your resume and speak to during interviews.</p>
