      <h2>Purpose</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="GridItem GridItem--half">
      <p>A primary goal of Dev Together is to be inclusive to the largest number of contributors, with the most varied and
      diverse backgrounds possible. As such, we are committed to providing a friendly, safe and welcoming environment for
      all, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, ability, physical appearance, body size,
      race, ethnicity, culture, national origin, immigration status, socioeconomic status, educational level, age, family
      status, and religion (or lack thereof).
      </p>
      <p>
      This code of conduct outlines our expectations for all those who participate in our community, as well as the
      consequences for unacceptable behavior.
      </p>
      <p>
      We invite all those who participate in Dev Together to help us create safe and positive experiences for everyone.

      <h2>Open Tech Citizenship</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="GridItem GridItem--half">
    <p>A supplemental goal of this Code of Conduct is to increase open tech citizenship by encouraging participants to
    recognize and strengthen the relationships between our actions and their effects on our community.
    </p>
    <p>
    Communities mirror the societies in which they exist and positive action is essential to counteract the many forms of
    inequality and abuses of power that exist in society.
    </p>
    <p>
    If you see someone who is making an extra effort to ensure our community is welcoming, friendly, and encourages all
    participants to contribute to the fullest extent, we want to know.
