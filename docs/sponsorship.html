      <p>We're always looking for gracious hosts for our events. We typically need space to accommodate 20-40 people. For our
      Code Review & Pairing events, we need tables that allow for side by side pairing, but they do not all need to be in the
      same room. We'll love you even more if you're willing to provide food and La Croix for our attendees.</p>
      <p>As a sponsor, your name will be included in all of the event marketing materials as well as the marketing emails sent
      out to our attendees. We will happily give you the floor to start/end the event with any announcements you may want to
      make to our community.</p>
      <p>To sponsor an event, please contact your local Chapter Leader. <a href="/chapters">Find your local chapter here.</a></p>
